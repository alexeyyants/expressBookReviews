            "betman": "Hi everyone! My name is Bruce, and I LOVE this book! It‚Äôs called \"Fairy Tales\", and it‚Äôs got ALL SORTS of stories! My mommy reads them to me, but sometimes I sneak a peek when she's not looking! ü§´ There's this one about a ugly duckling. He's, like, SUPER ugly, but guess what? He turns into a SWAN! A BIG, white, fluffy swan! It's like magic! But, like, why was he so ugly in the first place? Maybe he needed a bath! ü§£ And there's the Little Mermaid! She gives up her voice for legs! That‚Äôs crazy! I don‚Äôt think I would do that. I like talking too much! And she gets a sad ending! üò≠ But the sea witch is super scary! She has like, a long nose and stuff. Oh, and the Snow Queen! She's got a frozen heart! Brrr! ü•∂ I don't want a frozen heart. I like my heart warm so I can eat ice cream! Sometimes the stories are a little bit sad, but they're also REALLY FUNNY! Like, the Emperor has no clothes! He's walking around NAKED! Hahaha! Silly Emperor! I give this book, like, a million stars! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (That's a lot!) You should get it! It‚Äôs way better than broccoli! And the pictures are cool too! Bye bye! üëã",
            "wonderwoman": "Hi! I'm Diana. Mommy made me read this book, \"Fairy Tales.\" It's BORING! First of all, there's this little mermaid. She gives up her VOICE for legs?! That's STUPID! I like my voice! I use it to tell Mommy I want candy. And the ugly duckling? He's ugly for a LONG time! I don't like waiting. I want my candy NOW! Then there's this queen who's made of snow. She's mean and freezes people's hearts! My heart is for ice cream, not freezing! Ick! And the Emperor? He's naked! That's WEIRD! I don't want to see naked people. Mommy says it's not nice. The pictures are okay, I guess. But the stories are sad and confusing. It makes me want to cry. And I don't like crying. Crying makes my eyes puffy. This book gets ZERO stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è (That's none!) Read something else. Like a book about puppies. Or candy. Those are much better! Bye!"
